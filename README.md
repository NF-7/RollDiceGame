# RollDiceGame

Simple game of rolling the dice and adding the rolled values (with some caveats).

More complicated project in JS after just starting with learning javascript and WebDev.

The idea of the project was to create a miniature game with eventlisteners, different states of the game different rules for certain rolled dice, and basic DOM manipulation exercise with modal windows.

In the script.js file, there are separators included in order to easily look over the code and what every instance of it does.

Included are the functions to display modal window, modify the background color and restart the game with adaptive score values for Player1 and Player2.

Included are the limits of what values are permitted and invalid.

This project was instructed as very basic DOM manipulation exercise and as an additional lessons in DOM manipulation in order to deepen javascript knowledge.

Code is reusable by anyone. Open to additional suggestions regarding code usage/better coding with DRY principle in mind.

This is the Slovenian version of the minigame. English version available upon request.
